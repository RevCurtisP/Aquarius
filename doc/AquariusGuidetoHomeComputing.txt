Your Aquarius is designed to operate within the locality in which it was purchased.
Because of local receiver requirements, your computer is tailored to operate on one only of the following television channel designations.
VHF O or I (switch selected)
VHF A or B (switch selected)
VHF 3 or 4 (switch selected)
UHF 36 (U.K. or South Africa)
In VHF models, a selector switch can be found on the rear of Aquarius to allow selection of an unused channel in your area.
* It should also be noted that operation of Aquarius should not be done simultaneously while using any form of TV video game as serious interference may
result.

HOOK-UP WITHOUT HANG-UPS
Carefully unpack your computer. Check to make sure that you have all these parts:
Computer
Power Cord with attached transformer
Television Hook-Up Cable (10 foot)
Antenna Switch Box
(See illustration of these parts on page 4.)
BEFORE YOU CONTINUE...
Take a minute to check the bottom of the computer. You will see two number - a model number and a serial number. Jot these numbers down on page 2 of
this section in the spaces provided

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10 PRINT "Enter # of lines (0-6):"
20 INPUT L
25 IF L>6 THEN PRINT CHR$(7):GOTO 10
60 PRINT "Enter HOUR (1-12):"
62 INPUT H
63 IF H>12 THEN PRINT CHR$(7):GOTO 60
64 PRINT "Enter MINUTES (1-59):"
66 INPUT M
67 IF M>59 THEN PRINT CHR$(7):GOTO 64
72 T=L*38+17
74 PRINT CHR$(11)
76 PRINT TAB(T)"TIME"
78 T=16
80 PRINT TAB(T) H"_:"M"_:"S
85 S=S+1
90 IF S>59 THEN M=M+1
95 IF S>59 THEN S=0
110 IF M>59 THEN H=H+1
120 IF M>59 THEN M=0
130 IF H>12 THEN H=1
140 FOR P=0 TO 850:NEXT P
150 GOTO 72

Now RUN the program. Is it a clock? It is! We'll build a fancier version in Chapter 11, but for now we DO have a clock. If you want your clock to stop, press
[CTL]-[C]. The next time you RUN your program, you can reset your clock again.
(P.S. Don't forget to save this program if you have a cassette recorder hooked up to your computer.)

CHAPTER 6 "A SPLASH OF COLOR" (PEEK and POKE, RAM matrix, PSET, PRESET and POINT)

Everything you have typed so far has appeared as black characters on a light 
blue background. Aquarius has much more than this to offer in the way of
color. In this chapter we will discover how to use the full range of colors 
built into your Aquarius home computer. There is math involved in using color, 
but fortunately,

    YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLUG NUMBERS INTO A COUPLE OF 
    SIMPLE FORMULAS AND AQUARIUS WILL HANDLE THE MATH FOR YOU.

So don't let the numbers put you off. Color makes a world of difference. (By 
the way, you will need a color TV set to get the most out of this chapter.)

POKING AROUND

POKE is a way of telling your computer to POKE something into a position on 
your TV screen. That something can be a CHARACTER or a COLOR - FOREGROUND 
and/or BACKGROUND color.

POKE A CHARACTER

You must give Aquarius 2 pieces of information:

    - WHICH CHARACTER to poke...given as a NUMBER. You get the number from the 
    Character Code List starting on page 6 of the Appendix.
    
    - WHERE on the TV screen to poke it. This is one of 960 squares which the 
    screen is divided into. You specify which square by a NUMBER. You get then 
number from the CHARACTER RAM MATRIX on page 4 of the Appendix.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of a statement to POKE A CHARACTER:

    POKE 12328,65

This tells Aquarius to POKE the letter A into the Home Position on the TV 
screen. 65 is the Character Code number for the letter A. 12328 is the number
on the Character RAM Matrix.

These numbers were simply plugged into a FORMULA. The FORMULA is the 
important thing to know, because you can look up the number for any
character or any screen position on the lists.

The FORMULA is:
POKE (screen position),(character number) <-NOTE THE COMMA

POKE A COLOR

You must give Aquarius 3 pieces of information:

    - WHAT FOREGROUND COLOR to poke (if you want one). This is the color you 
    give to whatever CHARACTER is printed in a particular screen position.
    This color is given as a NUMBER. You get the number from the Color Code 
    List on page 3 of this chapter.
    
    - WHAT BACKGROUND COLOR to poke (if you want one). This is the color of 
    the screen itself in a particular position. The color is also given as a
    NUMBER, which you get from the Color Code List on page 3.
    
    - WHERE on the screen to poke these colors. This is one of 960 squares 
    which the screen is divided into. You specify which square by a NUMBER, 
    which you get from the COLOR RAM MATRIX on page 5 of the Appendix.

Example of a statement to POKE A COLOR:

    POKE 13352,5*16+3 <-NOTE THE COMMA

This tells Aquarius to poke the FOREGROUND COLOR, VIOLET and the BACKGROUND 
COLOR, YELLOW into the HOME POSITION. 13352 is the number for the Home 
Position on the COLOR RAM MATRIX. 5 is the number for violet. 3 is the 
number for yellow.

These numbers were PLUGGED INTO A FORMULA. The FORMULA is what you need to 
know to plug ANY color into ANY screen position. (You can always
look the number up.)

The FORMULA IS:

    POKE (screen position), (foreground color) * 16 + (background color)

    If you don't specify a foreground color, you will get BLACK.
    If you don't specify a background color, you will get LIGHT BLUE-GREEN.

POKE BOTH CHARACTER AND COLOR

If you want to POKE BOTH a character and color into the same screen position, 
you will need to use TWO POKE statements - one for the character and one for 
the color. Example...To POKE a RED letter A into a DARK BLUE BACKGROUND in 
the HOME POSITION, use these two statements:

    POKE 12328,65
    POKE 13352,1*16+11 
    (1 is the color code for Red and 11 is the color code for dark blue.)

CHARACTER RAM MATRIX / COLOR RAM MATRIX

Let's look at your television screen again.

Aquarius divides your TV screen into 24 rows and 40 columns. When you type a 
program, you can type in 38 of the 40 columns. But ALL 40 COLUMNS can contain 
a color or character, when a program is run, if you use the POKE statement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

STR$(ex)
ex=an arithmetic expression, numeric constant or variable
Example: Result:
10 A=176
20 A$=STR$(A)
30 PRINT LEFT$(A$,3) 17 (preceded by blank)
TAB
Advances cursor to a specified column. Data is printed in the next available print positions.
Columns are numbered from 0 (left margin) to 39 (right margin). If the position specified in the TAB argument overflows the right margin, the remaining
spaces are inserted on following line.
Format:
TAB(ex)
ex=an arithmetic expression, numeric constant or variable in the range 0 to 255
Examples: Result:
PRINT "AQUARIUS";TAB(12)"LOVES YOU" AQUARIUS LOVES YOU
10 FOR X=2 TO 10 STEP 2 AQUARIUS AQUARIUS
20 PRINT TAB(X)"AQUARIUS" AQUARIUS AQUARIUS
30 NEXT X AQUARIUS
To move cursor down the screen a specified number of lines (L) to a specified TAB position (P), use this formula: TAB(L*38+P)
TAN
Returns the tangent (in radians) of the argument.
Format:

TAN(ex)
ex=an arithmetic expression, numeric constant or variable
Example: Result:
PRINT TAN(45) 1.61977

USR
Branches to a user-created machine code subroutine. Machine code has 
certain advantages over BASIC, in terms of execution speed and memory
requirements. It is not as easy to learn as BASIC, and it is beyond 
the scope of this guide. You may want to study machine code and learn 
it use it in BASIC program subroutines to make your program more 
efficient and responsive.

Only one USR function may be defined in memory. The starting memory 
address of machine code subroutines are stored in addresses 14340 and 14341.

VAL
Converts a character string into a numeric value. VAL is the inverse of STR$. The string must contain valid numbers. If string contains a plus or minus sign,
it must precede numbers. The function returns a value of zero if the first character of the string is not a number or valid sign.
Format:

VAL(sv$)
sv$=name of the string variable containing the character string
Example: Result:
10 INPUT SV$ ? -99
20 PRINT VAL(SV$) -99
30 GOTO 10 ? 31- 31 ? xyz 0 ? 9-2 9 ? AQUARIUS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


THE CLEAR STATEMENT

Once you establish the dimension of an array, the only ways to change it 
are with the NEW command (which erases everything in memory) or the CLEAR
statement. The CLEAR statement ERASES THE VALUES STORED IN ALL VARIABLES 
UP TO THAT STATEMENT.

Example:

    10 DIM FOOD(11) Establishes a string array with room for 12 elements.
    20 FOOD(0)=300.00 Assigns values to first 3 elements of the array.
    30 FOOD(1)=290.00
    40 FOOD(2)=330.00
    50 ? FOOD(0),FOOD(1),FOOD(2) Prints values of first three array elements.
    60 CLEAR Sets dimensions of FOOD to 0. Sets values of FOOD(0), FOOD(1) and FOOD(2) to zero.
    70 PHONE(0)=70.00 Assigns values to PHONE(0) and
    80 PHONE(1)=52.00 PHONE(1).
    90 ? PHONE(0),PHONE(1) Prints values of PHONE(0) and PHONE(1). Notice that these
    values were not affected by the preceding CLEAR statement.
    100 ? FOOD(0),FOOD(1),FOOD(2) Prints value of FOOD array elements which are now blank
    (represented by Aquarius as 0).

Be careful that you don't accidentally erase the value of a variable which you
want to use again. If you do, re-assign the erased value to that variable.

ASSIGNING VALUES TO AN ARRAY
Once you set up an array, you can assign values to the array elements in three ways - with LET statements, INPUT statements or READ and DATA
statements
