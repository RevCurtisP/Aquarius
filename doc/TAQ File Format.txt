TAQ - Mattel Aquarius Raw Tape Image File Format

A TAQ image is a cycle-accurate binary representation of the signals 
sent to and/or received from the cassette I/O port. 


A TAQ file contains an ASCII header immediately followed by the binary
image data.

Header 

The header consists of the format identifier "TAQ" followed by the 
version as a string in "#.#" format, an optional comment block, and 
an ASCII NUL. The reference header is

    TAQ1.0\n

Data

The image data is a series of little endian unsigned 16-bit words 
representing a state transition on the cassette I/O port.

The high bit of the word indicates the bit value sent to the I/O port,
either 0 or 1, while the low 15 bits is the binary value of the time 
elapsed since the opposite bit value was sent in CPU cycles. The maximum
cycle count is 32768 and higher counts are truncated to that value.

Consecutive words with the same high bit represent multiple writes of the
same bit value to the port with no writes of the complementary bit
value in between. In this case, The period of that state is the sum
of the binary cycles counts in the words.

Consequently, each word represents the duration of one half of each
wave on in the signal, where a high bit of 0 indicates the time from
crest to trough, while a 1 indicates the tume from trough to crest.

The ROM cassette encode each data bit as two full waves, with longer 
(lower frequency) waves representing a 0 and shorter (higher frequency) 
waves representing a 1. So a 0 data bit might be encoded as

   07ed 87ed 079c 883e
   
while a 1 data bit might ne encoded as

   041f 837c 041f 83ce
